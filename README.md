## Planning

### Problem
We are constantly looking for different ways to move around today, looking for clean sources of energy and a proactive, enjoyable experience on the road. At the same time, many of our charging needs can't wait except for at these stress-free times.

### Concept
Our idea is to build a bike generator to charge small devices, including cell phones. This is modeled off stationary generators which can already function as a solid source of electricity. However, in order to make this mobile so it doesn't seem trivially time-wasting, we can make this function as the bike is mobile. Although this requires more initial input in energy, the electricity which can be harnessed is also well worth it. 

### Research

### Rough Sketches

### Diagrams

### Variations
After we complete the main idea of this project, we have several other ideas of where to go. First of all, we could add an LCD display, most importantly checking the status of the generator and if it is communicating with the device it is charging. Additionally, it might help to add a motor so electricity could be stored in a hybrid format and make it easier to pedal. However, this is an ambitious addition and likely will not be visited.

### Gearbox
We attempted to fabricate a gear box. We decided against this however because the
gears were made of PLA. The gears would imediatley strip if used for this purpose.
